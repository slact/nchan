Multiplexing Support and Config (alpha)

Support only to subscribe in multiple channels. Publish to multi channel is not supported yet.

**TODO**:
- use group config as normal behavior
- return the oldest message - by now it's taking the first one
- support multiplexing for NGX_HTTP_PUSH_MECHANISM_INTERVALPOLL
- others minor todo commented in the code


---------------- Configuration Directives & Variables ------------------------
Variables:
$push_channel_template
	A template to match and extract the query info: Channel id, message time and tag.
	Valid template vars are: 
		%C -> channel id
		%M -> message date, same of if-modified-since
		%T -> message etag, same of if-none-match (etag)	
  Example:
		# to match /broadcast/multi/sub/ch=CH1&m=123&t=1/ch=CH2&m=456&t=2 ...
		location ~ ^/broadcast/multi/sub(.*)$ {
			set $push_channel_id $1;
			push_multi_channel_subscribe on;
			set $push_channel_template '/ch=%C&m=%M&t=%T';

		push_publisher;
		push_store_messages on;

When subscribing to multiples channels, the oldest message of all will be 
returned. If no message was found, the subscriber will wait for any message
in all subscribed channels.
